A program I worked on long ago and lost track of. I believe it was to detect and notify myself/roommates if a stove burner was left on. It was an arduino program that utilized the SPIFFs library to write data to a external SD card and TWI to interact with a temperature sensor. The project title _I think_ is a reference to a 2 Chainz lyric....
